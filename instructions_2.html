            You are a purchaser of goods in an online marketplace that consists of three different vendors.
            The goods sold by each vendor are exactly the same. There are ten rounds in total, and you are required
            to make one purchase in each round. <br><br>
            The vendors are unchanged in each round. However, their average rating is updated for their performance in the previous round.<br><br>
            Due to delivery issues in the market, orders sometimes arrive in bad condition. 
            If the order arrives in bad condition it will be rated 1<img src="./assets/images/star.svg" alt="star" height="20px">. 
            Whereas,  orders that arrive in good condition are rated as 5<img src="./assets/images/star.svg" alt="star" height="20px">. 
            Each 5<img src="./assets/images/star.svg" alt="star" height="20px"> purchase is valued at £1, and each 
            1<img src="./assets/images/star.svg" alt="star" height="20px"> is valued at £0. <br><br>
            Each vendor is randomly allocated a type, Good and Bad. Products arrive in good condition from Good vendors
            more often than from Bad vendors. However, at times, products arrive in bad condition from 
            both types of vendor.<br><br>
            Given delivery is, outside the control of the vendors, if a product arrives in 
            good condition in one round, it does not mean it will arrive in good condition in the following 
            round, and vice versa.
