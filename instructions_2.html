            You are a purchaser of goods in an online marketplace that consists of three different vendors.
            The goods sold by each vendor are exactly the same.<br><br>
            Due to delivery issues in the market, orders sometimes arrive in bad condition. 
            If the order arrives in bad condition you will be paid £0. Whereas, you are paid £1 for orders that arrive 
            in good condition.<br><br>
            Vendors are real people who are paid for the number of sales they make that arrive in good condition.<br><br> 
            Each vendor is randomly allocated a type, Good and Bad. Products arrive in good condition from Good vendors
            more often than from Bad vendors. However, at times, products arrive in bad condition from 
            both types of vendor.<br><br>
            Finally, given delivery is, outside the control of the vendors, if a product arrives in 
            good condition in one round, it does not mean it will arrive in good condition in the following 
            round, and vice versa.
